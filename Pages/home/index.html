                        All the attractions, places, and objects located there have become part of it. Your tourist trip is the round in the game. You are a pawn, moving through trails, valleys, and other places, where tasks await you! When you solve them, you'll learn interesting facts and stories related to the history, culture, and characters of this place.
                        
                        Our touristic games are based on a scenario that'll guide you through the most interesting places in a concrete location. It allows you to see them from a different perspective, spend time in an active way, and above all - have fun!
                        
                        If you like to actively rest, explore new places in an alternative way, and have fun, sign up. All you need is a phone/tablet, good shoes, and humor!
                        
                        Sounds interesting? Take part! </p>

                    <p id="mainPageTextL">The world we live in changes every day. We experience many different stimuli, technologies develop at a rapid pace. Under these conditions, classic tourism, which consists of visiting a place with a guide, becomes boring for many people. We want something more, we want experience! 
                        <br><br>


                        A touristic game is something that answers this need. It's active, great fun, in which in some way we become the heroes. We may feel like the first settlers, rulers of nations or generals commanding battles. We discover secrets, hidden facts. Sometimes we are like journalists, sometimes like detectives. We have a mystery to solve, but in order to do it,  we have to solve puzzles and complete tasks.
                        <br><br>
                        
                        
                        We travel back in time and change places. We are focused on the tasks awaiting us and their solutions, and thus - we break away from reality. We spend time actively,alone or with relatives, friends. We share knowledge, skills and discover new ones. We learn more about interesting facts, stories, and people. And above it all - we are having fun!</p>

                        Residents of the cities, towns, visitors, tourists, families with children, couples, groups of friends or colleagues - anyone who wants to experience a fascinating adventure and interactive fun. Age, gender, national origin, education and all other variables are not relevant. <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        
                        Touristic game can be played alone or in groups. <br>
                        
                        Groups usually consist of 2 to 5 people. This number of participants assures that everyone will have something to do. The process of solving the tasks goes more interesting and also faster. Too many people in the group makes the level of engagement lower (and this is not what we want).  Each game may have specific requirements about e.g. wearing special shoes or taking special clothes. All details you may find in the game's descriptions.
                        <br><br>
                        
                        
                        There is also a special type of game - it may be organized for a specific person or for a concrete ocasion, like e.g. birthday, some anniversary, finishing school, etc. Then participants are those, for whom the game is designed. Others are heroes who have tasks to solve. 
                        <br>
                        Tasks are personalized, connected with interests, story, lifestyle of those people. <br>
